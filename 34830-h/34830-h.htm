<h2>CHAPTER I.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>FRANKIE'S SILVER CUP.</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Do</span> you wish to know who
little Frankie was, and where
he lived? Come and sit down
in your pretty chair by my side,
and I will tell you. Frankie
was not the real name of this
little boy. When he was a tiny<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
baby, not much larger than black
Dinah, his father came home one
night from his store, and asked,
"Have you named the baby yet,
mamma?"</p>

<p>"No," she answered, "I have
not; but I have been thinking
that if you are pleased, I should
like to call him Frank."</p>

<p>"Frank, Frank, Frankie," said
his father, repeating it over and
over again, to hear how it would
sound. "Yes, I like the name;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
and then my friend, Mr. Wallace,
is called Frank. Yes, Frank it
shall be."</p>

<p>"While he is a baby, we will
call him Frankie," said his mamma.
So that was the way he
obtained so pretty a name.</p>

<p>About a week after this, there
came one day a man on horseback
riding up to the front door.
He jumped briskly down upon
the wide stone step, and rang
the bell with a loud, quick jerk,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
which seemed to say, I am in a
hurry. Margie, the errand girl,
ran to the door, when the man
gave her a box wrapped nicely
in a piece of yellow paper, and
tied with a small red cord. Then
he sprang upon the saddle, and
galloped away down the avenue
into the road.</p>

<p>Margie carried the box into
the parlor, and gave it to her
mistress. Mamma looked at the
name on the paper, and her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
bright, loving eyes grew still
brighter. She took her scissors
and cut the cord which held the
paper around the box, then pulled
off the cover, and what do you
think was there? Why, a large
piece of pink cotton nicely folded
about a beautiful silver cup, on
one side of which was marked
the name <i>Little Frankie</i>.</p>

<p>Mamma laughed as she read
it, and felt sure the pretty present
came from Mr. Wallace. She<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
ran gayly up stairs into the nursery,
where the baby was sitting
in the lap of his nurse, shaking
his coral bells. "Here, my darling,"
she said; "see what a nice
cup has come for you; look! it
is so bright I can peep at your
rosy face in it."</p>

<p>Baby crowed and stretched
out his tiny hands, but he could
not quite reach it; and if he could
he would have tried to crowd it
into his mouth. So mamma took<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
him in her arms, and squeezed
him very tight, and kissed him
ever so many times, until the
little fellow was quite astonished.
Then she held him off a little to
look at him; and her eyes were so
brimful of love that Frankie was
never tired of gazing into them.</p>

<p>By and by, mamma carried
the baby and the new cup down
to the parlor; for papa had just
come in, and was already calling
for them.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>

<p>Papa admired the present very
much, and said that his friend,
Mr. Wallace, was a noble fellow,
and he should be glad if their
little Frankie made as good a
man. Then papa danced around
the room, "to give his boy a
little exercise," he said, "and
make him grow." But mamma
screamed, and was afraid so much
shaking would take away her
baby's breath.</p>

<p>"Come, then," said papa, "we<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
will sit down and trot a little."
He seated the little fellow on
his knee, and began, "This is
the way the lady rides, trot, trot,
trot, trot. This is the way the
gentleman rides, de canter, de
canter, de canter, de canter. This
is the way the huntsman rides,
de gallop, de gallop, de gallop."</p>

<p>Frankie laughed and cooed,
and as soon as his papa stopped,
kicked his little feet to have it
go again.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>FRANKIE'S LITTLE NURSE.</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Frankie</span> lived in a quiet, pleasant
village about twenty miles
from the city. His home was a
pretty cottage with a steep roof
rising above the windows of the
second story. In front there
was a smooth, green lawn, and
at the side a lovely flower garden,
with nicely gravelled walks leading
through it. Then back of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
the house there were beds of
peas, and beans, and turnips, and
beets, and all kinds of good
things for the table.</p>

<p>Frankie had a brother whose
name was Willie, and who was
five years older than he. There
had been a dear sister, too, but
when she was only one year old,
the Saviour called her home to
heaven; and she went with a
sweet smile upon her lip.</p>

<p>Beside his father, and mother,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
and Willie, there were in Frankie's
home, Jane, the cook, Sally, the
nurse, and Margie, a little girl
seven years of age, who loved
dearly to dance about and amuse
the baby boy. She was the
daughter of Jane, and her father
had been dead many years. She
had begun to go to school; but
as soon as the teacher rang the
bell for the scholars to go home,
Margie caught her bonnet from
the hook, and ran away as fast<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
as she could go, she was so impatient
to see little Frankie.</p>

<p>Early in the morning, long
before his mamma was ready to
awake, the little fellow would
open his eyes and crow, and
sing his morning song. Then
he would try to get his tiny
toes into his mouth. As soon
as Margie heard him, she would
knock softly at the door, and
ask, "May I come in and play
with Frankie?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>

<p>If you were to see her, you
would think she was quite an
old lady; she went around so
steadily, and not at all like a
school girl. First, she took all
the pillows from the cradle, and
shook them up. Then she laid
them back so that the baby
could sit up and see her play
to him. When all was ready,
she would go to the side of the
bed, and Frankie's papa would
put him carefully into her arms,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
and then turn over to take another
nap.</p>

<p>It was very strange that with
all Margie's singing and laughing,
and crying "catchee, catchee, now
catch baby;" and with Frankie's
happy shouts of delight, papa
and mamma could sleep quite
soundly. But the instant the
little fellow cried, as he sometimes
did when he hurt his gums
against his coral ring, and Margie
said, "O dear! has he hurt him?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
Margie's sorry," mamma would
spring from bed and be wide
awake in a minute.</p>

<p>There was one other member
of the family whom I have not
yet mentioned. It was not a
brother, nor a sister, but a large
black dog, whose name was
Ponto. He was a very handsome
fellow, with his shining
black hair, and his white ring
about his neck; and he held his
head up and looked you right in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
the face, as if he knew that he
was above common dogs. Ponto
liked to run in the garden with
Willie, and catch the sticks his
young master threw to him between
his teeth. But best of
all he liked to follow him to the
nursery, and watch the motions
of the new comer. Frankie's
eyes grew very large the first
time he felt Ponto's cold nose
on his arm; and he cried, when
the great, black creature began<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
to lick his hands and face.
Mamma tried to push Ponto
away, and Willie laughed most
merrily.</p>

<p>This, you know, was Ponto's
way of showing that he was
fond of the dear baby; and
from this time a strong affection
sprang up between them. While
Frankie slept, the dog lay down
by the cradle, to be sure that
no harm came to his precious
charge; and when he awoke,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
Ponto made a noise, meaning,
"I'll take care of you, baby."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>FRANKIE'S JUMPER.</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Frankie</span> was now six months
old. He had begun to sit upon
the floor. First he could only sit
there by having pillows placed
all about him. Then one day
nurse took away the pillows, and
said the little fellow must learn
to do without them. She set
him up very straight, and put a
large book outside his clothes<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
between his feet, so that he could
not easily fall over. Then she
took her sewing and sat down
on the floor beside him.</p>

<p>Frankie laughed, and thought
this was very fine; but in one
minute he reached a little too
far, and over he went right on
to his nose.</p>

<p>Nurse caught him up before
he had time to cry, and tossed
him up and down until he had
forgotten his trouble; then she<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
set him down again. So that
by the time mamma came home
from a long walk, he had almost
learned to sit alone.</p>

<p>O, how much pleased mamma
was! She took off her bonnet
and shawl, laughing all the time,
and then she stopped ever so
many times while she was giving
the little fellow his dinner, and
squeezed him closer to her side,
and told him he was getting to
be a brave boy indeed.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>

<p>Hearing so much that was
merry, Ponto roused himself
from his sleep, and began to
rap with his tail on the floor.
Then, when Frankie crowed out
a pretty sound, he sprang upon
his feet, and looked around a
minute with his great, black eyes,
when he gave a loud bark, "<i>bow,
wow, wow</i>." Little boy, I say,
"<i>bow, wow, wow</i>."</p>

<p>One day Willie went with his
mother to call upon a lady who<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
had a baby girl just about as old
as Frankie. The servant asked
them to go to the nursery and
see the baby in her jumper. O,
what a funny sight that was!
How the two mammas, and the
nurse, and Willie laughed, to see
the little creature dance about
from one side of the room to the
other. Frankie's mamma said
her little boy must have a
jumper too.</p>

<p>The lady, whose name was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
Ida Mills, gave her the pattern
of the little jacket her baby
wore when she jumped; and
Mrs. Gray said she would ask
her husband to call and see
the jumper, so that he could
tell the carpenter how to make
one.</p>

<p>In two days Frankie's jacket
was ready, and his jumper too.
His mamma had told him all
about it. But he only laughed
and cooed the same as ever,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
and did not seem at all to understand
it.</p>

<p>When papa came home to
dinner that day, he heard such
a loud noise from the nursery,
that he ran quickly up there to
see what was the matter.</p>

<p>When he opened the door he
saw his little boy fastened to a
long pole, which swung about
the room like a crane, and
mamma on her knees trying to
teach him to touch his little toes<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
to the floor, and make himself
dance. There, too, were Jane, the
cook, and Sally, the nurse, laughing,
while Margie and Willie
were clapping their hands every
time Frankie gave a spring.</p>

<p>Just then Ponto came running
up the stairs, and as soon as he
saw his little master, he began
to bark most furiously. He did
not like to see him hung up so,
and he meant to give his opinion
about it.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<p>Frankie had for a long time
been fond of using his feet, and
had often done so in his mother's
lap, until he almost sprang out
of her arms; but at first he did
not know what mamma wanted
him to do. But presently he
began to jump; and when he
found how easily he could set
himself to dancing, he was so
much pleased that he gave a
scream of delight.</p>

<p>Willie ran to the other side<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
of the room, and put his coral
bells in a chair, and called out,
"Come, Frankie, come to brother;"
and the little dancer jumped
across the room as briskly as if
he had done it every day of his
life.</p>

<p>O, what laughing there was
then! What shouting! What
clapping of hands! Mamma
ran to kiss her baby, and call
him her darling boy.</p>

<p>All this time the dinner was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
on the table; and at last, Jane
said, "O, dear, the dinner will be
as cold as a stone!" But papa
and mamma said they had rather
see Frankie learn to jump, than
to eat the best dinner that ever
was cooked.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>FRANKIE'S BROTHER WILLIE.</div>


<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was a long time before
Ponto became reconciled to see
Frankie in his jumper. He
barked loud and long, as if he
was afraid his little friend would
hurt himself, tied up in so strange
a manner. But baby grew every
day more fond of this exercise;
and as soon as he saw his mother
take the jacket, he would spring<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
so that she could hardly hold
him still enough to fasten the
buttons tightly to the wooden
frame. One day, when he and
his mamma were alone in the
nursery, he grew very sleepy,
and at last his little head nodded
down, down, quite upon his breast.
Mamma laughed softly, and she
waited a minute to see what he
would do. Presently he awoke
a little, and touched his toes to
the floor to make the jumper<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
spring, and get himself to sleep
again. Then she took him in
her arms, and after loosing the
buttons to his jacket, laid him
in his cradle for a nice nap.</p>

<p>One day Willie came running
into the room when mamma was
singing to the baby, who was not
well. He was a good boy, and
knew that he must not make
a noise; so he took a cricket, and
sat down by her side. He loved
to hear the gentle lullaby; but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
now he wondered why mamma
looked so sober. Pretty soon
he saw one, two, three, tears drop
right upon Frankie's head. Her
face was always so full of smiles
that he knew not what to make
of it. She got up to put the
baby in the cradle, and then she
saw Willie looking at her as if
he wondered what this meant.</p>

<p>"Come here, my dear," she
said softly, laying his head on
her shoulder. "Mamma has been<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
praying the good God for you
and your little brother."</p>

<p>"Are you afraid Frankie is
going to die, as sister did?"
asked Willie; "I saw some tears
on your cheeks."</p>

<p>"No, dear," said mamma.
"I was thinking how kind God
was to give me two such dear
boys. Then I looked at Frankie's
hands, such pretty little fingers
and thumbs, and I asked God
never to let them do that which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
was naughty, never to allow
them to strike or take what did
not belong to them."</p>

<p>Willie gazed a moment at his
hands; I suppose he was trying
to think whether they had been
naughty hands or good hands.
Presently he said, "Toes can't do
wrong, I think, mamma, as hands
can."</p>

<p>"Ah, yes, my dear," said his
mother. "Only yesterday I knew
a little boy whose feet were very<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
naughty, and walked away where
he had been forbidden to go."</p>

<p>Willie's face grew very red.
"I forgot about that," he said in
a whisper.</p>

<p>"Do you remember," asked
his mother, "the lady who visited
here with her little girl,
and how she used to kick and
stamp her feet when she could
not do exactly as she wished?
Were those good feet, and do
you think her heavenly Father<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
was pleased to see how she was
using them?"</p>

<p>"O, no, indeed, mamma! But
I guess God liked it when I used
my feet to carry James Wells's ball
home, because he would have lost
it if I had not given it to him."</p>

<p>"Yes, dear, your feet and your
hands, too, were good then; and
beside that, there was a kind
feeling in your heart, which made
you wish to carry the ball to
the poor boy."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>

<p>"I'm glad I did it," said Willie,
smiling in his mother's face.
"Did you think any thing about
Frankie's mouth?"</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed, I prayed that
my darling baby might use his
sweet little mouth to praise God,
and that never, no, never might
a naughty word come out of it.
O, how dreadful it is to think
that little boys or little girls
should use the gifts of the good
God to disobey his holy laws!"</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>FRANKIE'S NEW LESSONS.</div>


<p><span class="smcap">When</span> Frankie was a year old,
his mamma thought it quite time
for him to learn to go to bed by
himself. So she took him up in
her chamber, and shut the blinds,
to keep out all the flies. Then
she gave him his luncheon, and
laid him on Willie's trundle-bed.
This was low; and she thought,
if he tried to get off, it would<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
not hurt him as much as if it
were higher. "Now," said she,
"my darling must be good, and
shut his eyes, and go to sleep;
and then mamma will come and
put on his pretty cap and shoes,
and take him to ride in his little
wagon." She kissed him, and
went into the dressing room, to
see what he would do.</p>

<p>But Frankie did not like this
at all, and he began to cry as
loud as he could, and call for his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
mamma to come back. When
he found this did no good, he
stuck up his stomach, and kicked
his feet, and at last he held his
breath until his mamma was
frightened, and ran to hold him
up.</p>

<p>"Frankie is naughty," she said;
"mamma can't kiss a naughty
boy." Then she laid him down
again, and started to go away.
But he cried as loud as ever,
until mamma was obliged to pat<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
his dear little hands until they
looked quite red. She went
away, and stood where she could
look through the crack of the
door. He called "mamma," two
or three times, and then, tired
with his crying, he fell asleep.</p>

<p>"Dear little Frankie!" she
said, coming to the bed and kissing
the tears off his rosy cheeks.
"It made mamma's heart ache
to whip him."</p>

<p>In a few days the little fellow<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
had learned this new lesson; and
though he missed his mother's
arms folded tenderly about him,
and the sweet smiles which
mingled with the hushaby in his
infant dreams, yet he grew reconciled
to it at last, and became
a very good baby.</p>

<p>Every day now he learned
something new; first to say,
"Wee," for Willie; then to hide
his tiny head behind a handkerchief,
as Margie did when she<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
played peep a-boo with him.
Another time he held out his
hand for the brush, and tried to
smooth Willie's hair; but instead
of that he tangled the close curls
most terribly, so that the poor
boy could hardly keep from crying
when mamma combed them
out again.</p>

<p>One morning Sally was ill,
and obliged to stay in bed.
Margie wished to play with
Frankie while her master, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
mistress, and Willie were at
prayers; but mamma said, "No;
Frankie may come to prayers
too."</p>

<p>Papa took the large Bible, and
Willie stood close by his side,
his little finger pointing to the
verses as the reading went on;
and the baby sat on his mother's
knee, his eyes very wide open, to
see all that was going on. He
looked first at mamma, and wondered,
I suppose, that she did not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
smile. Then he turned to papa,
who was reading serious words
in a solemn tone. He gazed
next in Willie's face; but Willie
was intent upon the book. At
last he caught a glimpse of Margie's
laughing eyes, and he spoke
right out. The little girl had
not heard one word of the reading.
She had been watching
Frankie, to see how he would
behave; and now, before she
thought where she was, she<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
laughed aloud. But when she
saw that her laughing had made
Willie smile and turn from his
book, and that her mistress
looked very sorry, she was sorry
too, and covered her blushing
face with her little apron.</p>

<p>Frankie sat very still while
they sang a pretty hymn beginning:&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem'>
"Majestic sweetness sits enthroned<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Upon the Saviour's brow."</span><br />
</div>

<div class='unindent'>But when papa and mamma<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
kneeled down, he tried to kneel
too; and seeing that mamma
shut her eyes, he closed his, but
opened them again in a minute,
and tried to get away to run
to Willie.</div>

<p>"Frankie is now a year and a
half old," said papa, "and must
learn to be still at prayers."</p>

<p>"Can't he come to dinner,
too, papa?" asked Willie. "I
am almost sure he will be
good."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>

<p>"I am willing, if mamma is,"
said papa.</p>

<p>"We will try him," said
mamma.</p>

<p>In the middle of the forenoon
a man came to the door bringing
a new high chair for Frankie to
sit at dinner. Papa had been to
the store and bought it for his
baby boy. "O, what a kind
papa!"</p>

<p>Frankie was very good the
first day and the second day<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
he came to dinner; but after
that he did not behave as well.
He pushed away the plate on
which mamma had mashed a
nice potato for him, and tried to
reach a dish in which Jane had
put some squash. His little fingers
were covered with squash,
and mamma had to ring the bell
for Margie to bring the sponge
and wash them.</p>

<p>The next day, when papa held
down his head to ask God to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
bless the food, Frankie bent his
face down to the table, and muttered
over something. I suppose
he thought he too was
praying.</p>

<p>"Will God care?" asked Willie.
"Baby don't know that it is
naughty to pray so."</p>

<p>"God never expects children
to behave any better than they
know how," replied mamma.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER VI.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>FRANKIE'S TEETH.</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Frankie's</span> brother Willie had
never been to school, but had
learned to read and spell at
home, reciting his lessons to his
mamma. Papa said he was now
old enough to recite with other
boys. So mamma bought him a
little satchel, with a strap to put
over his shoulder. Then she put
in it his slate, with a pencil and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
sponge tied to it, his reading
book, and a new arithmetic with
pictures of marbles, and birds,
and boys in it. She washed his
face and hands very clean, and
curled his hair, which was so
long it hung over his shoulders;
then she dressed him in his new
suit, with his nice shining collar
basted into the neck, so as to
have him quite ready when his
young companion called for him
to go to the new school.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>

<p>Willie felt very happy this
bright morning. He liked the
idea of going with the other
boys to school. He thought it
would be fine fun to play ball
at recess. There was another
reason for his feeling happy.
Can you guess what it was?
It was not that his clothes were
new, and, as he could see in the
glass, fitted him very well. No,
it was because he had two pockets
in his pantaloons. Before<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
this time he had never had but
one, and now he felt smart indeed
to be able to place both
hands in his pockets. He walked
backwards and forwards before
the long mirror in his mother's
chamber, admiring himself exceedingly.</p>

<p>Mamma laughed heartily at
the airs he put on; but before
he went out, she told him no
persons but rowdies walked with
their hands in their pockets; that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
papa never did, and she should
be very sorry to see her Willie
walk so.</p>

<p>For a few days Frankie's
cheeks had been very red indeed,
so that Sally said he
looked as handsome as a picter;
but mamma was afraid it
was because he was not well.
He had a large tin bath tub in
the form of a boat, and one
morning, when she put him in
it, she found his flesh was very<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
hot. She took him out into the
flannel blanket, which she always
spread in her lap, and rubbed
him quickly, that he should not
become chilled; then she coaxed
him to let her put her finger into
his mouth to feel whether he
had any teeth which troubled
him and made him look so
feverish.</p>

<p>He had already quite a mouth
full of teeth; but she soon found
that there were two large back<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
teeth trying to force their way
through the gums.</p>

<p>"Poor little fellow," she said;
"mamma is sorry his teeth ache."
She laid his aching head on her
bosom, and passed her soft hand
soothingly over it, back and forth,
a great many times, chanting his
favorite little song, until at length
he fell asleep.</p>

<div class='poem'>
"Once there was a little man,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Where a little river ran;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And he had a little farm,</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">And a little dairy, O!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And he had a little plough,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And a pretty dapple cow,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Which he often called</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">His pretty little Pharaoh.</span><br />
<br />
"And the little maiden, Ann,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">With her pretty little can,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Went a milking when the</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Morning sun was beaming, O!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">But she fell,&mdash;I don't know how,&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And she stumbled o'er the plough,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And the cow was much astonished</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">At her screaming, O!</span><br />
<br />
"Then the funny little man<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">To the little river ran,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">To procure a little shiner</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">For his dinner, O!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Then he brought it on a hook</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">To the pretty little cook,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And she placed it on the table</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">With his ladle, O!</span><br />
<br />
"Then the little maiden ran<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">With her pretty little can,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And brought some nice sweet milk from</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Good Mooley, Mrs. Pharaoh!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And she poured it in a bowl</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">For the clever little soul;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And she placed it by his dish,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">While he sat at table, O!"</span><br />
</div>

<p>Then she went and laid him
in her own bed, and took her
sewing to sit down beside him
till he awoke.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>

<p>Presently nurse came in with
mamma's bonnet in her hand,
and mamma's shawl on her arm,
as the lady had told her she was
going to walk. But now she said,
"Frankie is ill, and I shall not
leave him to-day."</p>

<p>"I thought he was not very
well this morning," said nurse,
"for he was very worrisome,
and would not eat his breakfast."</p>

<p>Mamma sat with her sewing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
for nearly an hour, while Frankie
slept, only once in a while he
would moan as if he was in
pain; and then she put her
hand on his head again.</p>

<p>When he awoke his eyes were
heavy, and instead of jumping
out of her lap to play, he laid
his head down on her shoulder.</p>

<p>"Does Frankie want some
breakfast?" asked mamma.</p>

<p>He nodded his head; but when
nurse brought him some nice<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
bread and milk in his silver porringer,
he only took one taste of
it, and then said, "Patty want
water." He could not well say
Frankie, but always called himself
Patty.</p>

<p>For several days the poor boy
was quite sick, and his mamma
never left him except to run for
a few moments to her meals.
When he was in great pain, she
soothed him, rocked him, and
carried him about the chamber.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
Then, when he felt a little better,
she sang him pretty songs, or
told him stories, or showed him
the pictures in his little books.</p>

<p>There was one little song he
always loved to hear; and once,
when papa and mamma were
singing at prayers, he made them
laugh by saying, "Mamma, sing
Patty tune, pitty tee." He could
not talk plain; but he meant
"pretty tree."</p>

<p>Perhaps you have never heard<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
this song; and I will repeat it
for you:&mdash;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>FRANKIE'S BREAKFAST.</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Frankie</span> was now old enough
to like to hear stories, and almost
every day he asked, "Pease tell
me tory, mamma." Sometimes,
when he did not feel like playing,
he would ask her a great
many times in a day.</p>

<p>One morning she went into
the nursery, after she had eaten
her own breakfast, and found<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
Sally feeding him with his bread
and milk.</p>

<p>"He spits it out, ma'am," she
said, "and won't let it down his
throat."</p>

<p>"Patty want pig, mamma," said
the little boy. He meant that he
wanted a fig.</p>

<p>"Has he had a fig this morning?"
asked mamma.</p>

<p>"Yes, ma'am," said nurse.
"Willie came in eating one, and
Frankie cried for it. So Willie<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
gave it right up to him, though
he had only taken one mouthful.
I think he is the generousest
boy, ma'am, that I ever
see."</p>

<p>Mamma smiled, and seemed
very happy when she heard this.
You know nothing makes mammas
so happy as to know that
their little boys and girls are
good. She said to herself, "Dear
child, I will give him another
when he comes in." Then she<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
took Frankie in her arms, and
told nurse to go and eat her
own breakfast. She tucked the
bib nicely around his neck, and
then she began to feed him.
But, as Sally said, he would not
let it down, but spit it all over
his clothes and mamma's hand.
"Patty want pig," he said again.</p>

<p>"No, darling, you must eat
your breakfast now," said mamma.
"Though it is not so sweet
as a fig, it is very good, and will<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
make my little boy grow and be
strong, so that he can run out to
play like Willie."</p>

<p>"Patty want pig, mamma,"
said the baby, putting up his
hand to pat mamma's face.
"Patty want pig vely much."</p>

<p>"Frankie shall have a fig by
and by," said mamma; "now I
will tell him a little story.</p>

<p>"Once there was a little boy;
his name was Harry. He had
no kind mamma to give him<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
good breakfasts. His mamma
had gone to heaven to live
with God.</p>

<p>"Little Harry was poor, and
often when he woke up he was
very hungry. But he could not
lay his head on his mamma's
breast, because she was dead,
you know. Poor little Harry
used to cry for somebody to
come and take care of him. All
babies need some person to hold
them and rock them."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>

<p>"Patty got mamma," cried the
little boy.</p>

<p>"Yes, darling, Frankie has a
mamma who loves him dearly,
and tries to take good care of
him, and makes him nice warm
clothes. But Harry had none.
The woman who let him live in
her house was too busy to attend
to him; so, when he was
cold, or hungry, or tired, and
wanted to lay his poor, weary
head in her lap, she had no time<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
to let him do so. Dear little fellow,
it would have done him so
much good to have some kind
mamma take him in her lap and
squeeze him close to her breast,
as mamma does Frankie, and
call him her darling, dear little
Harry. I think he would have
stopped crying at once, and he
would have looked up in her
face and smiled his thanks."</p>

<p>Frankie was so much pleased
with the story, that he put up<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
his little mouth to kiss mamma;
and when he had done so, he
patted her face softly, and said,
"Patty love oo." He could not
say "you."</p>

<p>"One day," said mamma, "a
kind lady called at the poorhouse
where Harry lived. He
was sitting on a little bed in the
corner, crying; but he stopped
when the lady went in. His
hair had not been combed for
many days; his face was very<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
dirty where the tears had run
down over his thin, pale cheeks;
his clothes were soiled and torn;
but the lady pitied him very
much. When she found he had
no mamma, and that his papa
was at work a great way off,
she wrapped her shawl about
the poor baby, and took him
home in her carriage.</p>

<p>"First of all she gave him a
cup of milk to drink, and then
she told nurse to bring some<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
warm water in a tub, and some
soap and towels, for she was
going to wash the poor baby.
She did not wonder then that
the poor little fellow cried, for
he was all sore, because he had
had no kind mamma to wash
him and put on nice powder.
She kept him in the water a
long time, and washed him very
clean; and then she told the
nurse to go up garret and bring
a small trunk with some baby<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
clothes in it. She had a little
baby once, and these were his
clothes. Then she tried to get
the snarls out of his hair, and
by this time Harry was so tired,
he was glad to go to sleep.</p>

<p>"When he woke up he began
to cry again, for he thought he
was back in his old home; but
as soon as he saw the kind lady,
he smiled very sweetly. He held
out his arms for her to take him.
She had some warm bread and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
milk all ready, and she took him
in her lap and put a towel round
his neck and fed him.</p>

<p>"He did not spit it out on his
clean clothes, but he ate it all,
and liked it very much; and then
he looked up in the kind face
that was bending over him so
fondly, and smiled, and tried to
stroke her cheek. This was all
the way he knew how to thank
her for his good breakfast."</p>

<p>When mamma had told the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
story, she took Frankie's cup
and began to feed him, and he
did not spit out one mouthful,
but ate the whole, even the
last drop.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>FRANKIE'S DOLLY.</div>


<p><span class="smcap">When</span> Willie was a little boy
about two years old, a good lady
came to see his mother. Her
name was Bryant, but Willie
could not speak such a very hard
word; so, after trying a long
time, he called her Bear. Papa
and mamma laughed heartily,
and said that was a funny name;
but in a few days they began to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
call her Bear too; and after a
while they thought it was a very
pretty name. Do you know why
they liked it so much? Because
good Bear was fond of Willie, and
very kind to him, and because
Willie said it in such a cunning
way. One day mamma folded up
a little blanket for Willie to carry
to bed for a baby, and Bear said,
"I will make him a pretty dolly,
and dress it all up, so that he
can have it to play with."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span></p>

<p>That very day she began to
work upon it. Mamma gave
her nice pieces of cloth, and she
made a black face, and curly hair,
and red lips, and a very flat nose,
and white eyes. Papa laughed
when they showed it to him, and
said, "he hoped Willie wouldn't
be afraid of it."</p>

<p>Then Bear made arms, and
hands, and legs, with red shoes,
on the feet. Then she made a
skirt, and a dress, and a sack for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
Dinah to put on when she was
cold, and a bonnet for her to
wear when she went to walk.
She did not let Willie see it
until it was all ready for him to
play with, and then she, and
mamma, and nurse stood looking
to see what he would do
with it.</p>

<p>"Pretty Dinah," said mamma,
kissing the dolly, and then putting
it into Willie's arms.</p>

<p>At first the little fellow looked<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
and looked, but did not touch
his new baby or smile at all;
but presently, when mamma
said, "Willie got two babies,"
and putting the one made of a
blanket by the side of it, he began
to understand what it was
for. When Willie was four years
old, Bear made some new clothes
for Dinah, a jacket and pantaloons,
and changed her name to
John. This, Willie did not like;
and one day hung dolly by a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
string to the nob of the shutter,
because he was not good, he said.</p>

<p>When Frankie was old enough
to play with a baby, dear kind
Bear had gone away where they
could never see her pleasant
smile again; but mamma made
a new dress, and put it on over
the pantaloons, and called dolly
Dinah again. While she was
sewing on it, the tears ran out
of her eyes and dropped on her
work. Willie ran to ask her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
what was the matter, and she
said, softly, "I am thinking of
Bear, my dear, and how she
would have loved our little
Frankie if she had lived."</p>

<p>"I am going to heaven some
day," said Willie; "and I'll ask
her to come back. I know she
will, when I tell her you cry so."</p>

<p>"If we are good, my dear
boy," said mamma, wiping her
eyes, "and try to please the Saviour,
and to obey all his holy<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
commands, we shall go to live
with her in heaven; but she can
never come back to us."</p>

<p>"I'm trying to grow good
every day, mamma," said Willie.</p>

<p>This was a long time before.
Now Frankie loved Dinah dearly;
and when he went to ride, she
had to go too. He used to hug
her and kiss her just as mamma
did him; and in all his plays with
Margie, Dinah was set up in a
chair, and had to play too.</p>
